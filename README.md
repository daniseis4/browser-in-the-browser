# Browser_in_Browser
A 'Browser in the browser' attack is a social engineering technique used by cybercriminals to deceive people. In this attack, a fake window is displayed within a web browser that appears to be from the system or a legitimate webpage, such as a login request or an important alert. The intention is to trick the victim into entering confidential information, such as passwords or personal data, into this fake window.

Browser In Browser is a merged project of mrd0x/BITB and FreeZeroDays/GoPhish-Templates with added support for theme colours and other minimal changes.
The window design is from Windows 10, if you use dark/light mode the window will adapt.
